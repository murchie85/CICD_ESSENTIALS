# OVERVIEW

This tutorial breif will talk you through getting up to speed using Github, Jenkins, AWS and hosting your own website. Click on LAB001 to begin! 

# GITHUB

![git](images/github.png "Github")

Github is a source code management tool - which is the foundation of all development practices, it is basically like dropbox for your code, bare minimum people upload their code here as a backup, you can also collaborate with others, share code, contribute to their code etc. 


# JENKINS

![jenkins](images/jenkins.jpeg)

Jenkins is a really powerful CICD pipeline tool, CICD stands for *Continuous Integration* & *Continuous Delivery* Basically Jenkins will tie into almost any development tool, from gitHub to AWS and Docker. Jenkins allows you to tie in and orchastrate all yoursoftware development tools. For example, Jenkins could control your flow that first you pull with github, then shell scripts run, then code is uploaded to AWS etc. Essentially giving you remote control and scheduling of development tools  

# AWS

AWS is the biggest and most powerful cloud development tool, from hosting, to containerisation and storage.
