# LETS BUILD A SIMPLE PYTHON CHATBOT


Chatbots are the new core of modern day sophisticated apps that require front end customer interaction. In this lab we will look at building our own simple non-intelligent app, but show how intelligence can be added or faked using a few simple tricks such as regex expressions. We will then build a more sophisticated app that we can deploy to facebook
Agenda:

* Python Chatbot Basics
* RegEx expressiosn 
* Hosting an intelligent chatbot on the cloud and deploying to facebook.
