Firstly you should know this page that you are reading is a github standard approach. Everygithub repo has a readme.md file, and that file displays simple text in a formatted way. 

# BASIC FORMAT (EXPAND)
<details>


# # BIG TITLE  

## ## H1 HEADING  

### ### H2 HEADING (and so on)  



To do bullet points, you just use the * then a space 

* bullet 1 
* bullet 2 
* bullet 3 

You can google markdown format or just check the link below for a one pager cheatsheet.  Don't worry about this too much, all you need to know is how to do a title, and bullet points - that will mean all your code folders will have a nice README that will display anytime someone accesses your github repo.

# GIT LIKE A BOSS

Github is a sourcecode management tool - which is the foundation of all development practices, it is basically like dropbox for your code, you basically updload your code here as a backup, you can collaborate with others, share code, contribute to their code etc. 

What you need to do is: 

1. Download and Install git on your computer
2. Make sure it works by opening command line or terminal and typing GIT
3. create a project folder on your computer where you will start developing from now on, each new project gets its own folder in your projects folder i.e. project/jenkins or project/aws

Once that is sorted the steps you will repeat over and over as you develop (and will make you look like a pro to non developers is this)

1. Write code on your computer
2. do a __ git add . __ on command line, this __adds__ your code ready to upload
3. do a ** git commit -m 'whatever message' ** this preps your code ready for upload
4. do a ** git push origin master ** this uploads your code to github. 

Thats it, so each time you are ready to updload you just do the following __add__ , __commit__ and __push__ jobs a goodun.
